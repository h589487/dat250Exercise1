# DAT250 - Assignment 2 Report


## Technical Problems Encountered During Installation
Initially I had some serialization problems when I tried to try the HTTP client testing, else there wasn't much installation problem I can think of.
The assignment itself I wasn't sure how much of it had to be finished before submitting for first draft.
Progress has been made with controllers, pollmanager to manage domain objects and domains.


## Pending Issues
Not that I can think of, but the project is still work in progress and alot has not been implemented yet.
